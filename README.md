### What App Does

**Mollusk-Memory-Game** is built with React.js. Thus, the application is component based, able to keeps track of change events using state, and updates to the page render dynamically and without page refresh. It tracks clicks and presents the user with a score. The game will track each clicked image a user makes. If the same image is clicked twice the game will be reset. Each correct click increments the users score by 1. The highest score for the session is saved and displayed to the user.


### Tech Used

* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - run-time environment to build a back-end server
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) - scripting language used to implement client-side dynamic behavior on HTML web pages
* [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - component library for a front-end responsive framework, rebuilt for React.
* [HTML](https://html.com/) - create pages/documents to be displayed in a web browser
* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_intro.asp) - customizing content, layout, colors, and fonts


### Built With
- Visual Studio Code - Text Editor






<!-- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
